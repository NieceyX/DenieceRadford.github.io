											About the Game
										</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Made in Unreal <br />
										Team Size: 12 <br />
										Timeline: about 8 months <br />
										Working on: Audio Engineer/Design, Production
									</p>
									<h2>
										As a Audio Engineer/Designer
									</h2>
									<p>
										I have filled the role as Audio Engineer/Designer. I used Cakewalk for my DAW and have messed around with a bunch of
										different sounds and music. I spent a lot of my time on our music system blueprint. I wanted to make a system that
										allowed the player to take however long they need in the game. Due to this, I thought one long track would be a bad route to take - I didn't want it to obviously loop. I have made
										short 20 measure tracks that flow into each other by keeping the baseline the same. Then, my music system blueprint will pick a random track out
										of the ones it's given to play. My prototype audio and some of music system can be seen and played below.
										<br />
										I was able to record the player efforts with a member of the team, and implement those into our game. I set up all of the player SFX within the animation notifies. 
										The only exception being some looping sounds and special sounds that are being called from the cpp code.
										<br />
										I had a lot of fun making the music system blueprint and am still tweaking it to make it better. I used the Quartz system that Unreal has, and it has worked
										very good for us so far.
										<br />

									<h2>
										As a Producer
									</h2>
									<p>
										I am filling the role of associate producer. I have managed Jira, held and participated in standups, as well as managed
										one of the feature teams for the project. On Jira, I have created and managed tickets for our sprints - including managing milestones
										and epics. I have helped create our Sprint Review decks and show off our work to the rest of the cohort.
