											About the Game
										</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Made in Unreal <br />
										Team Size: 12 <br />
										Timeline: about 8 months <br />
										Working on: Production, Sound Design
									</p>
									<h2>
									As a Producer
									</h2>
									<p>
										I am filling the role of associative producer. So far, I have managed Jira, held and participated in standups, as well as managed 
										one of the feature teams for the project. On Jira, I have created and managed tickets for our sprints - including managing milestones 
										and epics. I have helped create our Sprint Review decks and show off our work to the rest of the cohort. I'm super excited for this project 
										and can't wait to see what our team can do!
									</p>
									<h2>
									As a Sound Designer
									</h2>
									<p>
										Also on our team, I have filled the role as Audio/Sound Designer. I have been using Cakewalk for my DAW and have messed around with a bunch of
										different sounds and music. So far on the project, I have been focusing most of my time here on our music system. I wanted to make a system that
										allowed the player to take however long they need in the game. Due to this, I thought one long track would be a bad route to take. I have made
										short 20 measure tracks that flow into each other by keeping the baseline the same. Then, my music system blueprint will pick a random track out
										of the ones it's given to play. My prototype audio and the current state of the music system can be seen and played below.
										<br />
										For the future of the project, I plan to have a different track selection for each of our levels. The idea is that the music and sounds of the city
										become creepier and more human-like as the player gets closer to the center/heart of the city. I am excited to start working on this aspect of the sounds.
										<br />
										I had a lot of fun making the music system blueprint and am still tweaking it as needed. I used the Quartz system that Unreal has, and it has worked
										very good for us so far. I'm excited to see where it grows from here!
										<br />
										On the SFX side, I have created an asset list of all of the different sounds we will need. I have found stand-in SFX for most of our needs from the 
										sound library we have access to, and will be working in the future to record our own sounds.
