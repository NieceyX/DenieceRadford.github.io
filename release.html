											About the Game
										</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Made in Unreal <br />
										Team Size: 5 <br />
										Timeline: about 3 weeks <br />
										Worked On: Game Design, Game Programming
									</p>
									<h2>
										As a Programmer
									</h2>
									<p>
										We had two programmers on our team, including myself. Since we had two parts of our game we each took one of those parts. For my part, I worked 
										on the music therepy section of our game. This is the second part of the game, where you go to after smashing glass objects. 
										<br />
										In this room, you are able to intereact with a bunch of glowing orbs. Since it is a VR game, you are able to reach out and touch the orbs with your 
										hands. Doing so will play a note, and each orb has its own unique note. The programming side of this was fairly simple, the trouble I had was just tweaking 
										it so it worked exactly how we wanted it to. One issue was the note repeatedly playing if the player held their hand in the orb. This would accidently happen 
										since it wouldn't take very long before it would play again. This was a simple fix by just adding a delay so it couldn't be played immediately again.
									</p>
									<h2>
										As a Designer
									</h2>
									<p>
										The team disscused as a whole what our direction was going to be, given the restriction of it being a serious game. We decided on a rage room and
										a music therepy room.
										<br />
										Since I was taking on the part of programming the music therepy room, I also had a hand in designing it as well. We had an amazing Sound Designer on our team, 
										and together we worked out that the room would be a bucnh of orbs that the player will be able to touch and play individual notes however they please. This was 
										a lot of fun to work on and implement. We also were able to talk to a subject matter expert (a therepist), and get insight on what we were doing right and wrong. 
										Hearing their feedback was a great thing for us, as we felt that we were working in the right direction overall.
