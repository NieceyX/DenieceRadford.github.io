							Protect your lawn by spraying intruders with your hose, send your dog to get the toys off of your lawn, keep yourself
							rocking in your chair to stay awake, and keep drinking your beverage to keep your energy up. This project is using an alt-controller made
							of a rocking chair and other elements to play the game.

											About the Game
										</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Made in Unreal <br />
										Team Size: 10 <br />
										Timeline: about 4 months <br />
										Worked On: Game Design, Game Audio

										Nominated for IndieCade 2023 Live Action Award! Also asked to be a part of
										IndieCade 2023 Night Games!

									<h2>
										As a Designer
									</h2>
									<p>
										This is an Alt-Ctrl game for my second semester graduate course. On the project, I helped work on design along with the
										rest of the team. This includes a dog mechanic that we ultimately had to cut. The dog was meant to be the way you gained points 
										within the game. On the controller side, the player would pat the dog's head, then in the game the dog would collect all the toys 
										on the lawn, which would increase your score. We cut this pretty early on due to time constraints, but it is a fun mechanic that 
										I like to share.
										<br />
										I also worked on designing other aspects of the game, which was largely a team effort. I designed the Main Menu and Tutorial screens 
										for the game (not including the art assets). It was a lot of fun to work with the cinematics in Unreal since it was my first time using 
										them, at the time.
									</p>
									<h2>
										As a Sound Designer
									</h2>
									<p>
										This project was the first one that I really worked on sound design in a game. Since I got a minor in Music Production, and have played 
										instruments my whole life, this was a lot of fun for me. I used the Cakewalk DAW, and made the title and main theme of the game. It took 
										me a bit of time to get the right sound, but I'm overall happy with how it turned out - though I've listened to it so many times now I can 
										hear it in my sleep.
										<br />
										I also worked on the SFX in the game. Most of the sounds are sourced from the audio library we have access to as students. I had plans to 
										record some of our own sounds, and we do have some when the old man yells, but due to time and being mostly focussed on the music, I didn't 
										have time to do this.
									</p>
									<p>
										Here is the main theme I made for the game:
									</p>
									<audio controls>
										<source src="audio/goml2.wav" type="audio/wav">
										Your browser does not support the audio element.
