											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Hey there!
											<br />
											I am about to graduate with my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Utah! I originally went to my undergrad for Computer Science
											and minored in Music Production at Buena Vista University. I've had a ton of fun in both programs and can't wait to get out there.
											<br />
											I love all things about creating games. Thinking critically about games, how they work, and what could be done better is really fun for me.
											There are so many different ways to do things, and they all have their own advantages and disadvantages. I am looking forward to
											keep designing and programming in different areas.
											<br />
											Along with this, I love music. I have played instruments for the majority of my life, starting before second grade. I have played 
											a couple different instruments, including guitar, violin, and piano, but my one true love is the saxophone (tenor more specifically). 
											I have had a passion for music and have been a part of concert and jazz band through my undergrad. Because of this, I have worked on 
											music and sound for a couple of my projects.
										</p>
										<p>
											Outside of game development, I love reading - though I have way too many books on my to-read list - and I, of course, love playing games.
											One of my all-time favorite game series is the original Mass Effect trilogy. These games are responsible for me wanting to make games as
											a kid, and they're super nostalgic for me. I still love playing them, and I've played the second game more times than most, probably.
											<br />
											One of my favorite games I've played recently is Baldur's Gate 3. I admire how the characters really feel alive, and games where you 
											can choose your own path have always held my fascination (as we can see with the Mass Effect trilogy). I am really enjoying the game, 
											and can't wait to try out different choices and paths - though I find it hard to be mean to NPC's in games.
