						<h1>Guerriere (2020)</h1>

							A third-person wave, fighting game. Use a sword and spell to fight waves of zombies and monsters, use health potions to heal up,
							and defeat both levels. The second game I ever made, and was worked on solo.

											Made in Unity
											Worked On: Game Design, Game Programming
										</p>
										<p>
											This project came out of my undergrad. What was originally supposed to be a VR and AR Video Game class became a 
											normal Unity game class once Covid hit.
										</p>
										<p>
											This project was my final project for the class, it was one of the first full experience games I had created. The requirements were 
											pretty loose for this project. I used free assets available on the Unity store.
										</p>
										<p>
											For the project, I programmed much of the code for the game, and designed the levels, where enemies spawned, and where items the player 
											could pick up were located. It was a solo project, so everything except for free assets and some other bits were all done by me.
